The agenda is to write a robust python code to check all the files and directories present in mentioned directories of the os.
The user will provide the input of the desired directories to scan upon the input prompt using spaces and the data is read by python as the prompt is being made by the `input()` function.
Python will take the input as a string and the `split()` function will split the data into a list which is stored into a variable.
if we write the input and split functions within a `tuple()`, python will automatically convert the data into a tuple.
`file.py` contains the code for handling data and storing it into a variable.
`basic.py` contains the basic version of code to run a for loop and fetch the list of files
`strong.py` contains the code with modularity and error handling in place.
