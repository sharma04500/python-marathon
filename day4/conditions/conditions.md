# Conditions --> If, Else, Else If

The condition.py file illustrates a clear example for the `if`, `else` and `elif` statements.

`if` statements are used to explore the conditional verification within a script i.e., to perform an action or execute a piece of code only if the given input satisfies the mentioned requirement.

`else` is used to mention an action to be performed when the declared if condition is not satisfied.

`elif` is used to declare multiple if conditions in order to broaden the scope of acceptance for satisfying a particular condition. `elif - else if`. Any number of elif statements can be written under an `if` statement.

If all the three conditions if, else and elif are stated, then the given condition is first scrutinized with the if condition, then with elif and if the input is not satisfactory with the if and elif statements, then the actions stated under else are executed.
So, the hirearchy or preference is : `if > elif > else`
